My First Website (6th Grade Project)

This is a simple website I created when I was in 6th grade, marking my first venture into writing proper code. Itâ€™s built entirely with basic HTML and CSS, showcasing my early curiosity and enthusiasm for web development.This project holds sentimental value as it reflects my starting point in the world of coding. It's a reminder of how far I've come and an inspiration for anyone taking their first steps in programming.
